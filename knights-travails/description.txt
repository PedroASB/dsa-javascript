On a standard 8x8 chess board, a knight can move two steps forward and one step to the side, 
or one step forward and two steps to the side. It can face any direction.

The task is to build a function knightMoves that shows the shortest possible way to get 
from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

The board has 2-dimensional coordinates. 
Calling the function would therefore look like:

knightMoves([0,0],[1,2]) // returns [[0,0],[1,2]]
